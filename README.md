## TypeScript Boilerplate
### Usage
- `yarn create tsb` or `npx create-tsb`
### Optional Flags
- Supplying an optional project name as a single word and using lowercase will cause the project to be installed in a subfolder with the name of the project.
- Supplying the optional `--use-npm` will use npm instead of yarn to install packages.
- Supplying the optional `--express` will set up boilerplate and install packages for using express.js.

### Usage examples
- `yarn create tsb my-project-name --use-npm --express` will create a TypeScript project with express boilerplate in the folder `my-project-name` that use npm to install packages.
- `npx create-tsb project-name` will create a TypeScript boilerplate project in the folder `project-name` using yarn to install packages.
